# Proof of Concept
## CPU Ray Tracer with Physicaly Based Rendering
My goals for this project was 1) to attempt building a ray tracer renderer from scratch to test my knowledge, and then 2) to learn physically based lighting techniques. 

Lighting still needs some work: shadows are too dark, whole image has too much noise, and I don't think I've reached proper physically based rendering yet. 

Still needs cube collider and triangle collider implementations.
